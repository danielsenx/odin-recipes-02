    </ul>

    <p>Instructions:
1. Toast the Bread
Lightly toast the sourdough slices to your preferred level of crispness.

2. Prepare the Toppings

Slice the avocado and cherry tomatoes.

If using fresh herbs, chop them now.

3. Poach the Eggs

Bring a small pot of water to a gentle simmer (not a rolling boil).

Add a teaspoon of white vinegar.

Crack each egg into a small bowl.

Create a gentle whirlpool in the water with a spoon and slide one egg in at a time.

Poach for about 3 minutes for a soft yolk or longer if desired.

Remove with a slotted spoon and gently blot on a paper towel.

4. Assemble the Toasts

Spread 1 tbsp of cream cheese on each toast slice.

Layer with smoked salmon.

Arrange avocado slices on top.

Add cherry tomato halves.

5. Top with Poached Egg

Carefully place one poached egg on each slice.

Season with salt and pepper.

Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle fresh herbs if desired.

6. Serve Immediately
Enjoy warm with a side of greens or fresh fruit for a full meal.
