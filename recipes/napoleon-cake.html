    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Napoleon Cake, also known as Mille-feuille (meaning "a thousand layers" in French), is a classic pastry made of layers of delicate puff pastry and rich pastry cream. Originating in France but popular across Europe and Russia, this cake is known for its flaky texture, creamy filling, and a balance of sweetness with a slight crunch. Traditionally topped with powdered sugar or a glazed icing, it's a showstopper dessert that's both elegant and indulgent.</p>
